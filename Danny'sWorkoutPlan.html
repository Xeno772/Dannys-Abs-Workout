                <li><span class="important">Warm-up:</span> Start with 5-10 minutes of light cardio like jogging in place, jumping jacks, and dynamic stretching (arm circles, leg swings).</li>
                <li><span class="important">Hurdling:</span> Include 10 minutes of light hurdle exercises or leg swings to improve flexibility.</li>
